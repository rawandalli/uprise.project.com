            <p>Uprise started with a simple question: Why do so many talented artists go unheard?</p>
            <p>We saw countless creators pouring their hearts into their music only to be drowned out by algorithms that favor fame over talent. Traditional platforms weren't built for them they were built for the already successful.</p>
            <p>So, we decided to create something different. A platform where emerging artists don't just upload their work they build their careers. Uprise is more than a streaming service it's a launchpad for the next generation of creatives.</p>
